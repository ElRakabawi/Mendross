# Mendross
Command line interface mendelian crossing algorithimc tool built with Perl.
It draws punett sqaure for three types of inheritence patterns: Monohybrid, dihybrid and trihybrid crossing.





**Roadmap**: <br/>
Stage 1: Command-line tool for Mono,di and trihybrid punnett square inheritance patterns. <br/>
Stage 2: Generalized binary tree algorithm for computing (N) numbers of genes. (i.e AABBCCDDEEXXYY)<br/>
Stage 3: Web GUI app for the tool. (using PerlDancer)



<br/>
Note: the CLI uses non-core perl module Text::Table, so make sure to download it first with the command `cpan Text::Table` if your find it hard due to permessions, open the CPAN shell in with sudo `sudo perl -MCPAN -e shell` then type `install Text::Table`.
