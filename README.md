# Mendross
Command line interface mendelian crossing algorithimc tool built with Perl. 
It draws punett sqaure for three types of inheritence patterns: Monohybrid, dihybrid and trihybrid crossing.





**Roadmap**: <br/>
Stage 1: Command-line tool for Mono,di and trihybrid punnett square inheritance patterns. <br/>
Stage 2: Generalized binary tree algorithm for computing (N) numbers of genes. (i.e AABBCCDDEEXXYY)<br/>
Stage 3: Web GUI app for the tool.
